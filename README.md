# Red Team Capability Maturity Model

This GitHub is primarily for managing community input and also provides the CMM in two file formats - Excel, if you trust me and want some formatting already done for you; and CSV, if you want to do some formatting yourself and think I'm sketchy. For the full model in your browser and other supporting information, see [the project website](https://www.redteammaturity.com).

# Here to Contribute?

Thanks for participating! Please submit a feature request with your suggested changes after reading the guidance below.

1. Read through the level descriptors included with the CMM and align your modifications to those descriptors. If you think a descriptor is missing but is needed to address your change, you can suggest that, too! Just make sure you provide descriptors at all five levels.

2. Think broadly. I'm sure we all have unique cases that are missing from this model, but we want to ensure people from various organizations at various levels of maturity can still leverage the model.

3. Include rationale for the change. Changes without rationale won't receive much attention, we want to know why you believe this helps improve the model for everyone.
